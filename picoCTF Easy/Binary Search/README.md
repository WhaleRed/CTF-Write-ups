# Description
Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.

# Hints
1. Have you ever played hot or cold? Binary search is a bit like that.
2. You have a very limited number of guesses. Try larger jumps between numbers!
3. The program will randomly choose a new number each time you connect. You can always try again, but you should start your binary search over from the beginning - try around 500. Can you think of why?

# Capture Start
Upon launching an instance you will be given an ```ssh```. If you want to know more about ssh you can type ```man ssh`` on the terminal. All you have to do is copy and paste that to your terminal and follow the instructions given to you after launching the instance. After entering the password the binary search game should run. To capture the flag, you have to guess the number like how a binary search algorithm finds an element.

# Binary Search Algorithm
Is an effective method for locating an element in a sorted list of elements. To reduce the number of potential location to just one, it repeatedly divides the section of the list that could contain the element in half. 
#
Now that we know what a binary search is we can now guess our way to capture the flag.

How the guessing game went for me:
