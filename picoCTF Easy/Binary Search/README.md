# Description
Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.

# Hints
1. Have you ever played hot or cold? Binary search is a bit like that.
2. You have a very limited number of guesses. Try larger jumps between numbers!
3. The program will randomly choose a new number each time you connect. You can always try again, but you should start your binary search over from the beginning - try around 500. Can you think of why?

# Capture Start
Upon launching an instance you will be given an ```ssh```. All you have to do is copy and paste that to your terminal and follow the instructions given to you after launching the instance.
